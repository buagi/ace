# Commands

Every `ace` subcommand, grouped by what it touches. Run `ace` with no argument for the interactive menu, or `ace --help` for the terse list.

## Global flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--dry-run` | preview: log what each step would do, change nothing |
| `--watch` | live-refresh mode — **`ace graph` only**. The dashboards already refresh live and ignore it; `ace watch` is a *command* (an alias of `ace dash`), not this flag |
| `--yes` / `-y` | assume-yes; auto-answer proceed-prompts with their safe default (headless) |
| `--confirm` | unlock a gated destructive op when non-interactive |
| `--json` | machine-readable output where a command supports it (`ace scorecard` · `ace reanalyze report`) |
| `--version` / `-V` | print the version |
| `--help` / `-h` | print usage |

> [!NOTE]
> **An unrecognised flag is a hard error.** `ace` prints `unknown flag: <flag>`, shows usage, and exits `1` — it never ignores one and continues. This matters because the old catch-all silently swallowed typos: `ace autorun -explain` (one dash) fell through to a **live autonomous build loop** instead of the read-only policy print. Note the single-dash form is still not a synonym — use `--explain`.
>
> Subcommand modifiers are parsed too, and **must follow the subcommand**: `ace debate score --capture`, not `ace debate --capture score`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run `ace` from **inside the project repo** for anything repo-scoped (`autorun` · `resume` · `release` · `vps *` · `deploy` · `profile` · `publish`). That is how it resolves which repo and branch it acts on.

## Rig

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `ace install` / `guided` | host tools + key + 12-agent config + GitHub login |
| `ace keys` | set/validate DeepSeek + Context7 key, pick model profile + overseer brain |
| `ace opencode` | (re)write the OpenCode config |
| `ace settings` | thematic submenus: providers/keys · which model each agent runs · model profile · appearance (theme/animation/art) · toolchain |
| `ace git` | git identity + `gh` login + credential helper |
| `ace status` / `doctor` | health check (tools · keys · `gh` · VPS · profile) ending in a **Readiness report** — a plain-language "✓ ready now / ⚠ needs setup (with the fix) / ◦ optional" summary + a single READY/NOT-READY verdict. Also printed at the end of `ace install`. |
| `ace logs` | tail the latest run/install log (`~/.config/ace/logs/`). |
| `ace firecrawl up\|down\|status` | ACE-managed **local** research crawler (self-hosted Firecrawl container, loopback-only, no cloud key). Optional — with it down, research falls back to `webfetch`. **`up` must precede `ace opencode`**: the MCP is enabled/disabled by a reachability probe at config-generation time, so starting the crawler afterwards leaves the MCP off for the whole run |
| `ace arch` | print the architecture overview and what-lives-where |
| `ace demo` | paced, **zero-credit** feature walkthrough for recording (`DEMO_AUTO=1` hands-free; see [demo/RECORDING.md](demo/RECORDING.md)) |
| `ace update` | update host tooling (`opencode` · `bun` · node · `uv`) |
| `ace uninstall` | remove ACE-managed config (gated: needs `--confirm` when non-interactive) |

## Build a project

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `ace scaffold` | NEW project (Node · Python · Go · Config) — full machinery |
| `ace profile` | view/edit the project profile; re-runs pre-fill from current values — see [profile.md](profile.md) |
| `ace profile --check` | validate `.opencode/profile.yaml` (required fields + enums + delivery coherence) |
| `ace publish [name]` | create + push the project's private GitHub repo so the loop can run — see note below |
| `ace upgrade` / `adopt` | EXISTING repo — add missing machinery (idempotent, safe); wires + activates the local `./ci.sh` gate |
| `ace package <name>` | add a correctly-wired TS workspace package (types resolve from source) |
| `ace stack [add <n>]` | list the scaffoldable stacks · `add` prints the template to register a new one — see [stacks.md](stacks.md) |
| `ace import` | pull existing code/data into `brownfield/` and map it |

`ace publish` is re-runnable:

- Re-pushes if `origin` is already set (recovers a failed push).
- If the name already exists, it offers **use / rename / abort**.
- Ends with a loop-readiness check.

`ace upgrade` activates the gate (`.githooks` via `core.hooksPath`) only when the repo has no custom hooks.

## Map and consistency

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `ace graph [--watch]` | refresh GitNexus + Serena + `docs/architecture.md` (agent code-map) |
| `ace atlas` | refresh the human Architecture Atlas — `docs/atlas.md` (system map · data flow · module map) + the README system-map block ([how it works](architecture-atlas.md)) |
| `ace consistency [fix]` | drift/scope guard: `main`↔`origin` · GitNexus · opencode DB · podman; add `fix` to reconcile |

## Git and safety

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `ace gitflow` | main + conventional commits + main-guard + PR template |
| `ace protect` | GitHub ruleset (PR + CI required; Pro-aware fallback) |
| `ace audit` | dependency vuln audit (pnpm / pip-audit / govulncheck, whichever the manifests call for) + outdated + tracked-file secret scan. The summary **names the checks that actually ran** and never generalises beyond them. Exit codes: `0` clean · `1` issues found · **`2` inconclusive** — no check could run (no supported manifest, or the audit tools are missing), which is explicitly *not* a pass. A secret scan that cannot list or read the tracked files also fails rather than reporting clean |

## The loop

**Start here.** `ace start` is the one verb for a run and `ace stop` is the one verb to end it; everything
below still works unchanged and is what `ace start` is built on.

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `ace start [N\|solo]` | **START A RUN.** `N` parallel workers (default **3**), `solo` = the single-flow loop, `fg` = don't detach. Resolves the prerequisites itself and **prints the policy it resolved before spending anything**, with the source of each value (`[env]` / `[config]` / `[default]`) — a default you can't see is a default you didn't choose. Defaults: **self-merge ON · spec debate ON · review debate ON · cited-URL verification ON · deploy off · features unlimited**. Precedence is **env > Settings > default**, so `AUTOMERGE=0 ace start` and the Settings toggles both win. Refuses to start over a run that is already live (two coordinators on one repo = two workers per item and a merge race), and says plainly when a debate is ON but has no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`/`DEBATE_MODEL_B` and will therefore **fail open** rather than protect you. |
| `ace stop` | **STOP whatever is running here** — the swarm coordinator and/or the `ace-loop` service, checking **both** rather than the first one it finds (they're independent, and stopping one leaves the other spending). A stop command that errors is reported as an error, never as "nothing was running". The one case it can't reach — a loop in the **foreground of another terminal** — it names explicitly. |
| `ace autorun` / `autoloop` | the autonomous pipeline — see [autorun.md](autorun.md) |
| `ace autorun --explain` | print the resolved delivery policy (`merge_gate` · `auto_merge` · `deploy_kind` · caps) — no run |
| `ace resume` | resume after an interruption — rescues uncommitted gate-green work, then continues |
| `ace stats` | **ONE REPORT SURFACE** — every section for this repo in the order you'd read them: **① tokens/cost** (per subagent × worker, from the opencode session DB) · **② quality** (critic false-positive rate, retries, escaped bugs) · **③ run scorecard** (the 8-level report + VERDICT) · **④ plan before→after** (did re-deriving the breakdown make it cleaner). Each section runs isolated, so one that errors or has no artifacts prints *“no data yet”* and the rest still render. `ace stats <section>` (`tokens`\|`quality`\|`scorecard`\|`plan`) prints just one; `ace stats sections` lists them. **Nothing was renamed or removed**: `ace stats global\|N\|task\|--by …` still routes straight to the token table, and `ace quality` / `ace scorecard` / `ace reanalyze report` all still work. `ace report` deliberately still means *file a GitHub issue* — the rollup lives here instead of quietly redefining an existing verb. `ACE_TELEMETRY=0` turns off all run logging. |
| `ace quality` | quality leading-indicators: per-critic false-positive rate + retry rate + escaped-bug → `.opencode/quality-report.md` |
| `ace scorecard` / `measure` [--json] | **multi-level run report** — one read-only rollup of a finished run across 8 levels: ① research (used/grounded) · ② feature-breakdown (spec gaps) · ③ subtasks (hit-rate + manageability) · ④ result quality · ⑤ debate barter · ⑥ logging completeness · ⑦ anomalies · ⑧ edge cases, + a top-line VERDICT. `--json` for machine use. <br>⑤ and ⑧ read the debate log (`.opencode/cache/debate-metrics.jsonl`), which is **cumulative across runs**, so they scope themselves to one run and **print the scope they actually counted**: the current `RUN_ID` when scored from inside the loop; otherwise the newest run in the log, but only when its records form a provable trailing block. Untagged or interleaved records (swarm workers, manual debates) cannot be isolated, so the scope falls back to `CUMULATIVE (whole log)` and says so — including in ⑧'s "0 issues across all HIGH-risk specs in scope" line and in `--json` (`debate_scope`). Pin a specific run with `SC_RUN=<RUN_ID> ace scorecard`; a pin that matches nothing reports no records rather than quietly widening back to the whole log. |
| `ace reanalyze` | **re-assess your OPEN (not-yet-implemented) features** — snapshots the current uncompleted ROADMAP items + specs, then re-derives their breakdown from scratch with the **full planning pipeline**: research → re-spec (template + EARS + cited) → deterministic spec-lint gate → **cross-model debate** (on by default here; fail-open without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` + `DEBATE_MODEL_B`) → bounded re-spec → re-slice. **Plan-only** (implements nothing), solo, headless. Roughly `REANALYZE=1 SPEC_DEBATE=1 ace autorun`. Use it to see whether the current pipeline breaks features down *better* than the existing plan before committing credits to building them. |
| `ace reanalyze report` [--json] | **before → after compare** — open-item count, specs new/changed, and the deterministic **spec-lint GAP delta** (did the breakdown get cleaner?) + a verdict, with pointers to `git diff` and `ace scorecard` for depth. The gap comparison is **gaps per spec**, not the raw total: a re-derivation usually changes the spec *count*, and 12 gaps over 8 specs is a cleaner breakdown than 6 over 2 even though the raw total doubled. Any side that was **not measured** renders as `—` (the unmeasured sentinel) and suppresses the comparison rather than scoring a vacuous `0`: a baseline with no specs was never linted, and a lint that failed to run produces no output. That distinction matters for the headline case — re-assessing a project that had no specs yet, which used to report *"MORE spec gaps than before"* for the one run where specs were first created. In `--json`, a measured rate is a bare number and an unmeasured one is `null`. Compares against the **first** baseline ever captured in this repo (`.opencode/reanalyze/before/`, marked by `.captured`) — the snapshot is deliberately write-once so repeated planning passes can't clobber the pristine starting point, which also means later re-assessments keep measuring against that original baseline, not the previous one. There is no reset subcommand: to re-baseline, delete the baseline directory by hand. |
| `ace debate spec <file>` / `review [base]` | run a **cross-model debate** on demand — two different LLMs (defender = your overseer, challenger = `DEBATE_MODEL_B` via OpenRouter) pressure-test a spec or the branch diff; transcript → `.opencode/cache/*-debate-*.md`, metrics → `debate-metrics.jsonl`. Needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. |
| `ace debate report` | analyze `.opencode/cache/debate-metrics.jsonl` — a per-debate table (rounds · converged · issues · duration) + aggregates (convergence rate · avg rounds · accepted/disputed totals). |
| `ace debate score [--capture\|--emit-tsv]` | **effectiveness** vs the labeled sandbox: precision · recall · F1 · accuracy (did it flag the seeded-flawed specs, pass the clean ones?), appends a trend point. `--capture` runs the live debate first (without it you are scoring the recorded transcripts as they stand); `--emit-tsv` emits the per-fixture rows for machine use. |
| `ace debate trend` | effectiveness **over time** + a conclusion (IMPROVING / REGRESSING / FLAT) from the history log. |
| `ace debate diagnose` | **manual improvement**: the false positives + false negatives from the last score, with transcripts + tuning hints. |
| `ace debate autotune <KNOB=value> [--stub]` | **automatic improvement** (opt-in): A/B a config knob on the sandbox, keep it only if F1↑ and cost not↑. `--stub` runs the A/B offline as a plumbing check (no credits, not a measurement). `ace debate autotune --propose-prompt` suggests a debater-prompt change for a human PR (never auto-applied). |
| `ace debate testproject [dir]` / `selftest` | materialize the labeled sandbox into a runnable throwaway project (watch the debate fire in a real autorun) · `selftest` = offline engine check (no credits). |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Inside the loop the debate is OFF by default.** `SPEC_DEBATE` and `REVIEW_DEBATE` both default to `0`, so a plain `ace autorun` / `ace swarm start` runs no debate at all — set them to `1` (env, or Settings → Cross-model debate) to enable it. `ace reanalyze` is the one exception: it turns `SPEC_DEBATE` on for its own plan-only pass.
>
> It is **fail-open**, not fail-closed: with `DEBATE_MODEL_B` unset the debate is *skipped with a warning* and the run continues — a green run is therefore not evidence that a debate happened. `DEBATE_MODEL_B` needs a provider prefix (`openrouter/vendor/model`) plus `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

> [!NOTE]
> `ace stats` (token/cost telemetry) is distinct from `ace loop stats` (per-run timing post-mortem, listed under [Remote control](#remote-control)).

## Swarm

Parallel loops: N path-disjoint workers, each self-merging. See [swarm.md](swarm.md).

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `ace swarm start [fg]\|stop` | start/stop the parallel workers — `start` detaches and drops into the cockpit; `start fg` runs the coordinator in the foreground |
| `ace swarm dash\|watch\|split` | live cockpit (per-worker pipeline + agents + feed + event bus); `split` = tmux columns |
| `ace swarm pause\|resume\|drain\|kill wN` | control workers — `drain` = finish current work, then stop |
| `ace swarm status\|stats\|tail\|logs` | read-only: worker state · per-run stats · tail the swarm log (`tail [n]`, default 40) |
| `ace swarm preflight` | preview the DECISION·SETUP·STATE table shown before a live start — no run |
| `ace swarm spec-lint [dir]` | run the deterministic spec-lint over `.opencode/specs/` (default) or a given dir |
| `ace swarm sandbox\|selftest\|policy\|policy-selftest\|wire` | free DRY demo · coordination tests · conflict-policy table · policy tests · per-project wiring (`wire check\|apply`) |

## Remote control

Run the loop as a detached systemd **user service** that survives terminal-close and is steerable from chat. See [remote-control.md](remote-control.md).

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `ace loop start\|stop\|restart\|status\|logs\|update` | control the loop service |
| `ace loop stats` | per-run timing post-mortem — time-by-phase + slowest steps (`.opencode/run-summary.txt` + `metrics.csv`) |
| `ace dash` / `ace watch` | ONE dashboard for either flow — auto-detects a running swarm (its cockpit) vs the single-flow loop (the solo dash). Same view whichever you type (`ace loop dash` / `ace swarm dash` route here too) |
| `ace loop dash [--demo]` | live full-screen dashboard: wordmark · status bar (with the live phase tag: research · spec-gate · implementing · …) · 11 agent boxes (recolor per state) · scrolling log. Watches a running loop; `--demo` plays a scripted preview |
| `ace hermes` | wire loop milestones + command-back to Hermes (→ Telegram/Signal/phone) |
| `ace hermes mcp\|webhook` | ground the chat agent on this repo (Serena/GitNexus) · route GitHub CI/PR events → chat |
| `ace approve [tok] yes\|no` | answer a pending loop merge-approval request (paired with `MERGE_APPROVAL=hermes`). No token = the newest pending request. **The decision is required and deny-by-default**: only `yes` `y` `approve` `approved` `ok` `1` `✅` (any casing) approves — anything else is recorded as a deny with a warning, and omitting the decision is an error |
| `ace schedule '<when>'` | register a recurring autorun via Hermes cron (`'0 9 * * 1-5'` · `'every 6h'`) |
| `ace brain` | file ACE host-lessons + this repo's `lessons.md` into gbrain (if present) |
| `ace awake on\|off\|status [dur]` | keep the machine awake/reachable while away (`on 4h` auto-releases) |
| `ace snap [--to signal] [--out f.png]` | screenshot the real themed CLI to a PNG (freeze/ansitoimg) and send it as a Signal/Telegram attachment |

## Ship

Build and release artifacts (Go). See [go-stack.md](go-stack.md).

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `ace release [--host]` | build hardened static binaries for the profile's targets — in a container; `--host` builds on the host |
| `ace release --tag vX.Y.Z` | cut a release: push a `v*` tag → fires the CI release job that builds + publishes the binaries |

## Deploy

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `ace vps` | VPS menu: configure · bootstrap · harden · wire-CI · provision · deploy · health · verify · check |
| `ace vps check` | readiness doctor (read-only): system · TLS · DNS · app · DB · firewall → verdict |
| `ace vps harden` | fail2ban · auto-updates · ufw · key-only SSH — opt-in, lockout-safe |
| `ace deploy` | pull + rebuild + restart on the VPS, then health-check (http or https) |
| `ace healthcheck` | poll the live deploy (container Running + HTTP) with a timeout |
| `ace verify` | agent: probe the live VPS → triage findings into `ROADMAP.md` |

## Headless (drive from Signal/Hermes)

Every flow is non-interactive: each choice is a flag or env var, so nothing blocks on a TTY.

- `--yes` / `ACE_YES=1` auto-answers proceed-prompts with their safe default. Secrets come from env (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`).
- Keys headless: `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=… ace keys --profile max --brain deepseek`.

New project — every infra choice is an explicit flag, nothing assumed:

```bash
ace scaffold --name <slug> --path <dir> --stack <node|python|go|config> \
  [--shape api|cli|cli-web|worker|library] [--audience …] \
  [--throughput low|medium|high] [--domain "…"] [--mission "…"] \
  [--no-git] [--no-ci] [--no-gitflow] [--no-container] [--no-vps] [--index] [--publish]
```

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--no-git` | no git at all (implies no CI/VPS/publish) |
| `--no-ci` | no Actions workflow |
| `--no-gitflow` | drop the gitflow guards |
| `--no-container` | host-only gate (no `Containerfile`; `./ci.sh --container` runs the host gate) |
| `--no-vps` | no VPS deploy |
| `--index` | index the new repo |
| `--publish` | create the GitHub remote the autorun loop needs |

Repo init is included unless `--no-git`.

> [!CAUTION]
> `deploy` · `uninstall` · `vps harden` refuse to run headlessly unless you add `--confirm`.

See [configuration.md](configuration.md#headless--signal) for the full env list.
